    	<h3>Emirge</h3></br><p>It’s hard to talk about Emigre or Zuzana Licko without mentioning the Macintosh computer. Type designer Zuzana Licko was born in Czechoslovakia in 1961 and immigrated to America in 1968. She graduated from the University of California Berkeley with a degree in Graphic Communications in 1984. This was around the same time she was first introduced to a Macintosh computer and, perhaps unknowingly, her future career. Upon reciving their first Mac, husband Rudy VanderLans remembers, “Zuzana just locked herself up for about a month and I couldn’t even talk to her. She started designing typefaces from the moment she turned it on.” (Designers on Mac) The two realized that now with the Macintosh it was possible to not only design a typeface but also save and use that typeface. Licko along with VanderLans and Emigre embraced the limitations and exploited the potential of the Macintosh computer. 
Licko’s typefaces evolved overtime as did the computer she made them on and the magazine they were printed in. All three influenced one another to continue to develop and change. Beginning on the coarse resolution screen of the first Mac computer, Licko was forced to design a pixel typeface that adhered to the grid. This structured type counterbalanced her husband’s organic compositions in Emigre. As time passed the computer’s screen began to have a better resolution, which allowed Licko to develop new fonts. She was now less pixel dependent and began to create experimental digital typography. These typefaces along with her early ones were featured in Emigre and brought the magazine critical acclaim. This exposure led to the production of Emigre Fonts, a foundry where Licko would now sell her typefaces. 
The computer became more common and modern culture caught up with Licko and Emigre. What was once considered experimental design was now the common way to communicate to the youth. Since Licko and VanderLans were never satisfied with convention, Emigre evolved, matured, and changed once again. The magazine changed its physical size and switched its focus from experimental compositions to refined articles. This influenced Licko to start creating fonts that were better suited for longer reads. Her favorite typeface, Bodoni, whose extreme contrast between thick and thin made it difficult to read long text at small sizes. So in 1996 she created Filosofia a Bodoni revival. Licko states, “When drawing a revival, I question the form of each character and element according to my own sensibilities, as though I were drawing it as an original design.” (Creative Type by Thames & Hudson)
